This exercise consists of two examples. 
You will test the convergence of total energy obtained
by pw.x calculations w.r.t. the plane wave cutoff energy (ecutwfc)
and k-point grid density via a Unix shell-script.

**Description of examples:**

* `ex1.ecutwfc/` -- convergence test for plane wave cutoff energy

* `ex2.kpoints/` -- convergence test for k-point grid density
