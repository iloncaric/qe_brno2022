# PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE: 
## Perform phonon calculations
-------------------------------------------------------

This exercise consists of two examples. 

**Description of examples:**

* `ex1.gamma/`      -- phonon frequencies at gamma-point, LO-TO splitting

* `ex2.dispersion/` -- phonon dispersion and DOS
